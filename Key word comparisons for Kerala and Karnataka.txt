Key Word Comparisons between Kerala and Karnataka 

Achieve, Capabilities & Central (for each word x41 for Karnataka and x22 for Kerala) :- 
For Kerala ads, these three words are used only in the following ad in unison, which is repeated "We will 
never achieve our developmental capabilities without our women in the workforce. We promise to 
reserve 33% of central govt. jobs only for women. Vote for Congress." Similarly for the Karnataka ads these three words are 
repeated again in unison for the exact same ad and same context. For both states the same ad was generated using these three words 
to reinforce the fact that developmental capabilities and women in the workforce are paramount and it is what Congress promises if voted. 
The higher number in Karnataka simply means more ads of the same type as in Kerala were generated using the same words. 

Comprehensive (x67 for Karnataka and x47 for Kerala) :- 
For Kerala, this word is used in two distinct ads, which are "We promise to ensure zero tolerance to violence 
of all forms and prevent hate crimes, through a comprehensive law to end such violent acts. Vote for Congress," and
"Under our comprehensive jobs plan, we will provide 24 lakh government &amp; public sector jobs. Vote for Congress." This is similarly 
repeated and generated as the same set of ads for the state of Karnataka. In these ads the party uses comprehensive 
to emphasize its committment towards curbing crime and ensuring public sector job security. The higher number in Karnataka simply means 
more ads of the same type as in Kerala were generated using the same words.
